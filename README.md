# EurekaWithRestGateway

* This project is using Eureka as a host for microservices for Java. And this is much closer to a real world application.
* Also this is an unfinished project due to some unknown issue underlying here. Not sure what is missing for them to compiled.

Thank you for your interest in looking into this project. Hope you learn something.
Keep on coding.
